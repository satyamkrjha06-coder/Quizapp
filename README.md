# Quizapp
Simple single-file quiz application.

Open `quiz.html` in your browser to run a small interactive multiple-choice quiz. The page is standalone (HTML/CSS/JS) and requires no build tools or server â€” just double-click the file or open it from your browser's File > Open menu.

Features
- 5 built-in sample questions (editable in `quiz.html`)
- Keyboard friendly (arrow keys + Enter)
- Shows score and lets you retry

To modify questions
1. Open `quiz.html` in a text editor.
2. Find the `questions` array in the script and edit or add entries using the same structure:

```js
{ q: 'Question text', choices: ['A','B','C','D'], a: 0 }
```

Where `a` is the zero-based index of the correct choice.

Enjoy!
```
